            Anushka Sharma was born on 1 May 1988 in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh.[2][3] Her father, Colonel Ajay Kumar
            Sharma, is an army officer, and her mother, Ashima Sharma, is a homemaker.[3][4] Her ancestral home is in
            Dehradun town of Uttarakhand on Naishvilla road, her father lived here before joining the Indian army.
            Anushka Sharma's grandmother Urmila still lives in their house. Sharma lived in Sheela Bhawan of Naishvilla
            road in her childhood.[5]

            Her father is a native of Uttar Pradesh, while her mother is a Garhwali.[6][7] Her elder brother is film
            producer Karnesh Sharma, who earlier served in the Merchant Navy.[8] Sharma has stated that being a military
            brat played an important role in shaping her as a person and contributing to her life.[3] In an interview
            with The Times of India in 2012, she said, "I take pride in saying that I am an army officer's daughter even
            more than being an actor."[3]

            Sharma was raised in Bangalore.[3] But she did her primary schooling at St. Mary's School, Margherita,
            Assam. Sakshi Dhoni, the wife of M.S Dhoni, was her classmate in that school.[9] She completed her schooling
            at Army School, Bangalore. Then she did her graduation in arts from Mount Carmel College, Bangalore.[10][11]

            She originally intended to pursue a career in modelling or journalism, and had no aspirations to be an
            actress.[10] After graduation, Sharma moved to Mumbai to further her modelling career.[12] She enrolled
            herself at the Elite Model Management, and was groomed by the style consultant Prasad Bidapa.[citation
            needed] In 2007, Sharma made her runway debut at the Lakme Fashion Week for designer Wendell Rodricks's Les
            Vamps Show and was picked to be his finale model at the Spring Summer 2007 Collection.[12] Since then she
            has done campaigns for the brands Silk & Shine, Whisper, Nathella Jewelry and Fiat Palio.[citation needed]
            Sharma later said, "I think I was born to emote and act. I would walk down the ramp and smile and they used
            to say, 'give us a blank look.' It was really difficult, not to smile".[12] Whilst modelling, Sharma also
            joined an acting school and began auditioning for film roles.[13][14]
