          Vettel started his Formula One career as a test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, making a one-off racing
          appearance
          in 2007. As part of the Red Bull Junior Team, Vettel appeared for Toro Rosso later that year and was kept as
          a
          full-time driver for 2008, where he scored a victory in the Italian Grand Prix to become the then-youngest
          race
          winner. Vettel was promoted to Red Bull in 2009. With Red Bull, Vettel won four consecutive titles from 2010
          to
          2013, the first of which made him the sport's youngest World Champion. In 2013, he set the record for the
          most
          consecutive race wins with nine.[7] Vettel signed for Ferrari for 2015 replacing Fernando Alonso and became
          Mercedes' and Lewis Hamilton's closest challenger in two title fights in 2017 and 2018, although he finished
          both
          years as runner-up. He parted ways with Ferrari at the end of the 2020 season to race with Aston Martin for
          the
          2021 and 2022 seasons, before retiring from Formula One at the end of the 2022 season.[8]

        <h2>Early and personal life</h2>
        <p>
          Vettel was born on 3 July 1987 in Heppenheim, West Germany,[3] to Norbert and Heike Vettel. He has one younger
          brother, Fabian, a racing driver, and two older sisters: Melanie, a dental technician, and Stefanie, a
          physiotherapist for disabled children.[9] Vettel suggested in an interview that he was "terrible" at school,
          but
          he passed his Abitur at Heppenheim's Starkenburg-Gymnasium [de] with a respectable grade.[10][11] His
          childhood
          heroes were "The three Michaels": Michael Schumacher, Michael Jordan and Michael Jackson. He mentioned that he
          wanted to be a singer like Jackson, but realised that he did not have the voice.[12] Vettel is also a fan of
          the
          Beatles, collecting several records, including Abbey Road and his favourite song being "Drive My Car". In an
          interview on Top Gear, he stated that he is a fan of British comedy such as Little Britain and Monty Python's
          Life
          of Brian. Vettel lives in Thurgovia, Switzerland, amongst other racing drivers and is a fan of German football
          team Eintracht Frankfurt.[13] Vettel has described himself as competitive, private and impatient. He also
          appeared
          in advertisements for Head & Shoulders,[14] and provided the voice of character Sebastian Schnell in the
          German
          dub of the 2011 film Cars 2,[15] and a voice command assistant in the German and Italian dubs of the 2017 film
          Cars 3.[16]

          Vettel married childhood friend Hanna Prater at a private ceremony in early 2019,[17] and they have three
          children.[18][19][20] In 2016, Forbes estimated that his annual income was $41 million.[21] Kimi Räikkönen,
          his
          teammate from 2015 to 2018, is a close friend.[22] Besides his native German, Vettel speaks English, French,
          Finnish and Italian.[23][24] In July 2022, he created his Instagram account,[25] having long eschewed social
          media.[26] Vettel's first Instagram post was to announce his retirement from Formula One at the end of the
          2022
          season.[27]

          On 31 May 2023, Vettel announced his involvement with the Germany SailGP Team, as co-owner of the team
          alongside
          Thomas Riedel.[28]

        <h2>Early career</h2>
        <p>
          Vettel began karting at the age of three, and began racing in karts series in 1995 at the age of eight. He was
          accepted into the Red Bull Junior Team in 1998,[29] and won various titles, such as the Junior Monaco Kart Cup
          in
          2001. Vettel was promoted to open-wheel cars in 2003, and was given a chance by Derrick Walker to test a
          Reynard
          Motorsport Champ Car in a two-day private test at the Homestead–Miami Speedway.[30] A year later, he won the
          2004
          Formula BMW ADAC championship with 18 victories from 20 races.[31]

          Vettel drove for ASL Mücke Motorsport in the 2005 Formula 3 Euro Series. He was placed fifth in the final
          standings with 63 points and won the Rookie Cup. He tested for the Williams Formula One team later that year
          as
          a
          reward for his Formula BMW success. Vettel then went on to test for the BMW Sauber Formula One team.[32][33]

          Vettel was promoted to test driver for BMW Sauber in 2006, and participated in the 2006 Formula 3 Euro Series,
          finishing as runner-up.[34] He also competed in the 2006 Formula Renault 3.5 Series, where he finished first
          and
          second at Misano in his first two races. In the next round at Spa-Francorchamps, his finger was almost sliced
          off
          by flying debris following an accident, and he was expected to be out for several weeks.[35] Nevertheless, he
          managed to compete in the 2006 Masters of Formula 3 at Zandvoort the following weekend, where he finished in
          sixth
          place.[36]

          Vettel competed in the 2007 Formula Renault 3.5 Series, and took his first win at the Nürburgring. He led the
          championship when he was called up permanently by the BMW Sauber Formula One team.[37]
